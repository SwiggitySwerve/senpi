/**
 * One host request, performed: ensure a daemon, report one, stop one, or hand one off.
 *
 * This is the whole behaviour behind `senpi host` - and behind the launchers that call the same
 * entry point in-process - separated from the command line that expresses it. Every request answers
 * with a JSON payload plus the exit code that payload means, so a CLI, a desktop and a task runner
 * report the same outcome with the same vocabulary:
 *
 *     0  the request happened            3  refused: a running host this client may not act on,
 *     4  no host is better than this one     an unreachable socket, or a stop that would end
 *        one (fallback policy)               somebody else's work
 *
 * The refusals are the point. One daemon holds every client's sessions on its endpoint, so a client
 * that cannot get what it wants must SAY so and leave the running host alone (I1) - never stop it,
 * never bind a second host over its socket. `decideHostAction`, `ensureHost`, `stopHost` and
 * `handoffHost` already enforce that; this module only gives their outcomes a machine-readable shape.
 *
 * A terminal control endpoint (`endpoint_kind: "tui"`) is owned by its terminal process and is never
 * ensured, handed off, drained or stopped by a host operator: `ensure`, `handoff` and `stop` against
 * one refuse with `unsupported_endpoint_kind` (exit 3) from disk alone, before any connection.

/**
 * The per-row detail of a status report: the sessions a host listed and the session-path claims its
 * endpoint's `reservations/` directory holds.
 *
 * Both are parsed here from what the host and the directory SAY, at the boundary, so the report
 * carries typed rows and never a raw reply. The listing is the same `list_sessions` reply the counts
 * are made from; the claims are read from the directory every generation of the endpoint shares, so
 * a path a draining predecessor still holds is visible even though the answering generation's own
 * listing no longer names it.
